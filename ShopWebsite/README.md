# “shop.com” Website Clone

![Homepage ](./Screenshots/HomePage.png)

### SHOP.COM is a new kind of shopping comparison site that offers the most comprehensive shopping experience on the web.

This is our first project at Masai School using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. We worked on “Shop.com”, an online shopping store.

## Technologies we used

1. We used HTML-5 and CSS-3 for front-end
2. Javascript for back-end
3. Localstorage is used for the data-storing purpose (as we are not introduced to the databases till now)
